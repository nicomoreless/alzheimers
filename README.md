Alzheimer's Disease 


Alzheimer's disease is a progressive and debilitating neurodegenerative disorder that affects memory and cognitive function. It is the most common cause of dementia in older adults and currently, there is no cure for the disease. The exact cause of Alzheimer's disease is not fully understood, but it is believed to be related to the accumulation of beta-amyloid plaques and tau tangles in the brain.

Beta-amyloid is a small peptide that can aggregate to form plaques in the brain, which is a hallmark of Alzheimer's disease. The accumulation of these plaques is thought to contribute to the development of the disease. In order to develop drugs that target beta-amyloid and potentially slow or stop the progression of Alzheimer's disease, researchers use different approaches such as, developing small molecules that can bind to and inhibit the formation of beta-amyloid plaques, or developing immunotherapies that can clear existing beta-amyloid plaques from the brain.

There have been several drugs developed that target beta-amyloid, but none of them have been successful in curing the disease. Some drugs, such as donepezil, rivastigmine, and galantamine, can temporarily improve symptoms but do not stop the progression of the disease. Therefore, there is a need to continue research and development of new drugs that can target beta-amyloid and slow or stop the progression of Alzheimer's disease.


My project is focused on drug discovery for Alzheimer's disease using machine learning and data analysis. The goal of this project is to use computational methods to identify new drug candidates that can target beta-amyloid and potentially slow or stop the progression of Alzheimer's disease
